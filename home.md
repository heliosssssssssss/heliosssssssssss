**ALERT ! KNOWN ISSUES BELOW AND WILL BE FIXED**

 - SecureAuth and MemoryAuth appear to reset or fail to authenticate sometimes. 
 - Mobile devices under 950,950 size appear to have an overflow issue on the tag tooltip.
 - There is several scrolling issues related to mobile devices, such as not being able to scroll down fully on the list.
 - Multiple UI issues related to auto-size and widget-control on mobile devices. Appears to be present on IOS so far. Android testing shows same results at a less rate. 
 - There (not-confirmed) may be a issue with selecting tags when creating a post, causing different tags to be selected rather than the desired ones. 
 - origin.helios.ac is blocking all requests from dev.helios.ac/origin-fastconnect but not from dev.helios.ac globally.
